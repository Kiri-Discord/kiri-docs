Welcome to my guide and documentation! This guide will let you know how to setup each features correctly, as well as walking you through every command that i deliver! Before we begin, here are some additional information that you should note:

## üìï How do i read this guide?

Here is how the formatting works on these docs globally:

| Formatting | Description                                                                       |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|   `<user>`   | Indicate a required arguments to fill. The whole command won't work without this! |
|   `[user]`   | Indicate an optional arguments that you can skip.                                 |              |

:::caution

Don't includes those `<>` and `[]` when writing the command, unless it's specified directly inside the documentation!
