# ðŸ“– Setup moderation logs channel

For each moderative action (such as kick, ban, prune), i also send logs so you can keep track of those update easily through a channel. This guide will guide you through the setup of moderation logs, and what i will and won't log.

## Setting up the channel

:::warning

Changing your server's moderation log channel require you to have the **Manage Server** permission!

:::

To change your server's moderation log channel, you could use this command `setmodlogs`:

```
k!setmodlogs <#channel>
```

Below is an example for changing the log channel to `#log`:

:::tip

Instead of mentioning the channel, you can also provide me an ID of the channel!

Here are some example of my log messages (might be changed without notices):

Congratulations, you have setup the moderation logs!

All moderative action processed through me, including:

* Usage of the `prune` command, along with the number of deleted messages coming from each author who was involved, as well as the responsible moderator.
