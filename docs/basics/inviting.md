# Inviting Kiri

I can either be invited to your server through the default **[invite link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=859116638820761630&permissions=4294831607&scope=bot%20applications.commands)**, or via the **[top.gg website](https://top.gg/bot/859116638820761630)**.

:::caution

Inviting with unofficial invite link from other site or unofficial bot listing can resulting in missing features (such as Slash Commands) and let your account **vulnerable**. Always invite me with invite links from this site if possible!

:::

## Inviting me to your server:

After clicking on one of those links above, a Discord OAuth2 page will pop up and you will see something like this:

:::caution

You need to have the **Manage Server** permission on the server to be able to invite me or other bots!

Choose the server you want to add it to and click **"Authorize"**. This should then present you a nice confirmation message:

Congratulations! I've been successfully added to your Discord server. I should show up in your server's member list somewhat like this:

:::note

I will also leave a welcome message in your server as well (if there is permission) that look like this!

## Making the first steps

Now that you have invited me to the server, it's time to start interacting! 
My default prefix is `k!` or mentioning, and also Slash Commands!

After that you can either [setup my permission on the server](./setup-permission), or [customizing the prefix](./setup-prefix) of your liking!
