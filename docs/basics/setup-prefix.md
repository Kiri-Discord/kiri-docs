# ðŸ’¬ Setting up your server prefix

After [setting up your permission](./setup-permission) you can even also customize my prefix to your liking in the server!

## Why this is recommended

If you have been on a server with a lot of bots, you might have encounter this situation before:

As you can see, commands with a common prefix have the chance to trigger other bots. As the number of bots on Discord is rapidly growing, my prefix can trigger other bots with the same prefix.

Aside normal prefix `k!`, i can also be summoned by using the mention as the prefix, and Slash Command as well!

## Changing your prefix

:::warning

Changing your server's prefix require you to have the **Manage Server** permission!

:::

To change your server's prefix, you could use the command `set-prefix`:

```
k!set-prefix <your prefix>
```

Below is an example for changing my prefix to `kiri`:

:::warning Note

Your prefix's character count must be greater than 1!
