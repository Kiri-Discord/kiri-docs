# Setting the feature

The scrolling lyrics feature requires a few fundamental thing, such as the text channel where the lyrics will be sent to, and the languange that you want Kiri to get. However the requirement can be different in different cases.

## When there isn't any queue running

Setting while no music is running is quite simple. You just have to set your channel to use by using `k!scrolling-lyrics set <#channel>` or `/scrolling-lyrics set`.

:::caution

You need to give Kiri the permission to `Send Message` and `Embed Links` in that channel!
